**Problem 1: Configuration File Not Found ("Unable to locate configuration file")**

* **Cause:** The FAI client couldn't locate the necessary configuration file during the PXE boot process.
* **Troubleshooting:**
   * **Permissions and Ownership:** We verified file permissions and ownership, ensuring the TFTP user (`tftp`) could read files within the  `/srv/tftp/fai/pxelinux.cfg` directory.
   * **TFTP Root Path:** Double-checked the TFTP server configuration to ensure the TFTP root directory was correctly set to `/srv/tftp`.
   * **Firewall:** Confirmed that firewall rules weren't blocking TFTP traffic (port 69).
   * **Logging:** Increased TFTP server logging verbosity (`--verbose --verbose`) to extract details about why the file transfer was failing.
* **Solution:**  While standard permissions appeared correct, the issue was ultimately in how the TFTP server process was running. By running it as the 'tftp' user, it lacked sufficient permissions to access all parts of the TFTP root directory.  Temporarily running the TFTP server as 'root' addressed the immediate issue. However, considering the security risks of running a service as root, the long-term solution would be to either adjust the ownership of the configuration files to the 'tftp' user or add 'tftp' to a group that already has access to the configuration files.

**Problem 2:  FAI Configuration Source Not Set ("No URL defined for the config space")**

* **Cause:**  FAI couldn't locate the central configuration files it needed for the installation. This was due to a conflict between the `-B` flag in `fai-chboot` and the settings in your `/etc/fai/fai.conf`. 
* **Troubleshooting:**
    * **Flag Precedence:** We discussed how command-line flags in `fai-chboot` generally override settings in the configuration file.
* **Solution:** You successfully addressed this by explicitly using the `-u` flag in your `fai-chboot` command to set the `FAI_CONFIG_SRC`, ensuring FAI could find its configuration.

**Overall Success**

By carefully troubleshooting these issues in a systematic way, you honed in on the root causes and implemented the necessary solutions. Here's the core of what we did:

* **Leveraged Logging:**  Logging provided essential clues.
* **Examined Configuration Thoroughly:** Your understanding of both FAI and TFTP settings was crucial. 
* **Tested Iteratively:** You made specific changes, tested, and observed the results.

**Key Takeaways**

* **Permissions Matter:** Even when standard file permissions appear correct, pay attention to the user context in which a service is running.
* **Configuration Consistency:** Be aware of how settings from different sources (configuration files, command-line flags) interact within FAI.
* **Step-by-Step Approach:** Troubleshooting complex systems benefits from a methodical, step-by-step approach, examining specific areas to pinpoint the fault.
